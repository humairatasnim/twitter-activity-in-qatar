Twitter Activity in Qatar v1.0
=========================


The objective of this project was to create a map that provides spatio-temporal information about the population of Qatar, by applying various filters to the tweets and categorizing them in various ways. Using the same framework for the map and data plotting using Google Fusion Tables, as was done in Project 1, the availability of three main filters on the website forms the crux of this project.

Firstly, users can filter the tweets based on the <strong>language</strong>. This is particularly helpful in identifying regions or districts where a specific language is dominant and these trends can be observed. Secondly, there is a filter for the <strong>day of the week</strong>. With this feature, it is easy to track and understand which days see the most activity by users in Qatar with regards to Twitter and can imply several things. Moreover, there is another fine filter that categorizes the tweets in a day into the various <strong>times of the day</strong>. With this filter, it is possible to track the peak times of each day in which the population in Qatar tweets the most. A combination of these three filters can provide meaningful insights into the behavior of the population in Qatar.
